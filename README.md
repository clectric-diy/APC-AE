# Naming your Project(s)
I claim no trademark to the terms "APC", "Atari Punk Console", or (of course) "Atari". You do you.

# Sharing your Project(s)
You are free to sell your own variations, but remember that this module is open hardware under the [CERN-OHL-S](https://gitlab.com/ohwr/project/cernohl/-/wikis/uploads/819d71bea3458f71fba6cf4fb0f2de6b/cern_ohl_s_v2.txt) license. This is a "strongly reciprocal" license, so you are required to share any changes, or an entire "combined work", as open hardware under the same license.

We have other hardware, such as [AE Modular Protoboards](https://github.com/clectric-diy/Protoboards-AE), that are licensed under the [CERN-OHL-W](https://gitlab.com/ohwr/project/cernohl/-/wikis/uploads/82b567f43ce515395f7ddbfbad7a8806/cern_ohl_w_v2.txt) "weakly reciprocal" variant. You can use those, under the terms of that variant, as components in your own projects.
